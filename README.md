# Memory Game Project

This project is my adaption of the [Udacity starter code](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game) on GitHub for a Card Memory/Matching Game. I made changes/additions to the HTML and CSS styling, and wrote all of the Javascript except for the shuffle algorithm known as the Fisher-Yates (aka Knuth) Shuffle.

## Instructions

Simply open the index.html file in your browser to begin the game.

Match all 16 cards to win.

## Contributing

This repository is in the process of being reviewed for completion credit as part of the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Program. Therefore, I most likely will not accept pull requests until I have received instructor feedback and complete this project.
